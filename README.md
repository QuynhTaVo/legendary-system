# legendary-system
A lame project for one useless online course using data from a sucker company(trust me, Airbnb truly sucks!)
Libraries: numpy, pandas, geopandas, folium, matplotlib, seaborn
Motivation: people often take time deciding where to go for the holidays, this will help them cut down the time spent for making that decision, and get the best experience for their time
Files:
- project1_crawling.ipynb: data crawling code
- project1_question1.ipynb: Which area is most attractive towards travellers?(Which geographic area has most of the listings? Most of the bookings? What about price, reviews?)
- project1_question2.ipynb: When should I visit a certain city?
- project1_question3.ipynb: Where should I stay in a certain city?
- project1_question4.ipynb: Does superhost correlate with anything at all?
Analysis summary: the project provides a good framework for analyzing places for vacation accomodation, still due to COVID-19 we could not get an analysis as good as expected
Acknowledgments: not to Airbnb and Udacity, to Wikipedia for the greatest common knowledge platform and Kaggle for teaching me basic Data Science skills
